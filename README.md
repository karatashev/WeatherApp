1. Your project should contain the following components:
   -Header
   -Blog( or BlogList)
   -BlogPost
   -Forecast
2. In the "Latest News" part you need to show three blog posts, which should contain (image(take
   them randomly from https://picsum.photos/ ), title, and description).

3. - For the "Forecast" part , you needfetch data from the following URL:
     http://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/forecast/daily?q=Skopje&units=metric&cnt=7&appid=886705b4c1182eb1c69f28eb8c520e20 and fill in the table with necessary data.

   - in order to show the correct icon in the table ( sun, cloud etc. ) use <img src= "http://openweathermap.org/img/w/APIICON.png}.png"> where instead of APIICON you should use the icon name from the API dynamically. http://openweathermap.org/img/w/10d.png

4. For the "Related News" part you should make the same thing as the first part (Latest News).
5. At last when you click on hamburger menu ,the menu should open/close(check the css for this one i have some tips there for you :P ).
